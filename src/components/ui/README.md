# ui/

Reusable UI primitives - the building blocks of the application.

These are generic, presentational components with no business logic.

Examples:
- Button
- Card
- Input
- Modal
- LoadingSpinner
- ErrorMessage

Follow the principle: these components are "dumb" - they receive props and render. No data fetching, no business logic.
